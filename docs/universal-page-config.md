A fundamental aspect of the page config is that it allows you to configure a page to be "HTML-static" or "HTML-dynamic" and "DOM-static" or "DOM-dynamic":
 - *HTML-static*
   <br/>
   The page is rendered to HTML at build-time.
   <br/>
   (In other words, the page is rendered to HTML only once, when Reframe is building the frontend.)
 - *HTML-dynamic*
   <br/>
   The page is rendered to HTML at request-time.
   <br/>
   (In other words, the page is (re-)rendered to HTML every time the user requests the page.)
 - *DOM-static*
   <br/>
   The page is not hydrated.
   <br/>
   (In other words, the DOM doesn't have any React component attached to it and the DOM will not change.)
 - *DOM-dynamic*
   <br/>
   The page is hydrated.
   <br/>
   (In other words, React components are attached to the DOM and the page's DOM will eventually be updated by React.)
