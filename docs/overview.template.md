### What is Reframe

Reframe allows you to create web apps by defining so-called "page configs".
Reframe takes care of the rest:
It automatically transpiles, bundles, routes, renders, and serves your pages.

~~~jsx
// Page config `WelcomePage`

const WelcomePage = {
  // Page's URL
  route: '/',

  // Page's React component
  view: () => <div>Welcome to Reframe</div>,

  // Page's <title>
  title: 'Welcome'
};

export default WelcomePage;
~~~

A *page config* is a plain JavaScript object that configures a page by assigning it
 - a React component (required),
 - a route (required), and
 - further (optional) page configurations (page's &lt;title&gt;, meta tags, whether the page's HTML should be rendered at build-time or at request-time, whether the page should be hydrated or not, etc.).

You can create a React web app with **no build configuration** and **no server configuration**.
(But, if you need to, everything is configurable/customizable.)

> All you need to create a web app is one React component and one page config per page.

Let's create a web app by defining a page config `HelloPage`:

~~~jsx
// ~/tmp/reframe-playground/pages/HelloPage.js

!INLINE ../examples/basics/pages/HelloPage.js --hide-source-path
~~~

The `reframe` CLI does the rest:

</p>

Reframe did the following:
 - Reframe searched for a `pages/` directory and found one at `~/tmp/reframe-playground/pages`.
 - Reframe read the `pages/` directory and found our page config at `~/tmp/reframe-playground/pages/HelloPage.js`.
 - Reframe used webpack to transpile `HelloPage.js`.
 - Reframe started a Node.js/hapi server that serves all static assets and renders our page's HTML.

With Reframe you can create:

 - **Modern interactive apps** <sup><sub>:sparkles:</sub></sup>
   <br/>
   Apps with a dynamic DOM where React is used to create interactive views.
   <br/>
   By default **Server-Side Rendering** (**SSR**) is enabled.
   (Pages are rendered to both the DOM and HTML.)
   SSR gives full control over SEO and improves perceived load time.
 - **Good ol' 1998 websites** <sup><sub>:floppy_disk:</sub></sup>
   <br/>
   Apps with a static DOM and where React is only used to render HTML.
   <br/>
   Pages are rendered to HTML either statically at build-time or dynamically at request-time.
   <br/>
   No (or almost no) JavaScript is loaded in the browser.
 - **Serverless** interactive apps & static websites
   <br/>
   Apps where all pages are rendered to HTML statically at build-time.
   <br/>
   The DOM can be static (static website) or dynamic (serverless interactive app).
   <br/>
   These apps don't need a Node.js server and can be deployed to a static host such as GitHub Pages or Netlify.
 - **Hybrid apps**
   <br/>
   Apps where some pages are DOM-static, some DOM-dynamic, some HTML-static, and some HTML-dynamic.
   <br/>
   Allowing you to create apps with the motto "If possible, implement features with non-interative views".
   (Non-interactive views are considerably easier to implement and also usually perform better.)

Reframe generates a certain type of app depending on how you configure your pages.
For example, if you add `htmlStatic: true` to a page config, then that page's HTML is rendered at build-time instead of request-time.
Thus, creating a serverless app is simply a matter of setting `htmlStatic: true` to all page configs.


### Why Reframe

 - **Easy**
   <br/>
   Create web apps by simply defining page configs and React components.
   Reframe takes care of the rest.
 - **Universal**
   <br/>
   Reframe is the only framework that supports every type of static and dynamic app.
   Instead of learning one framework to create a static app and a second framework to create a dynamic app,
   you can learn Reframe to be able to create both static and dynamic apps.
   <br/>
   [Reframe Rationale - Universal](/docs/reframe-rationale.md#universal) shows what different types of apps there are and how Reframe supports them all.
 - **Escapable**
   <br/>
   The vast majority of your code will be entirely independent of Reframe.
   This means that, if you decide to get rid of Reframe, you will have to rewrite only few parts of your code.
   <br/>
   And Reframe is designed so that you can progressively replace Reframe code with code of your own.
   That way, you can progressively get rid of Reframe to eventually take full control over your app.

Also,
Reframe is based on **plugins** (React Router v4 plugin, TypeScript plugin, PostCSS plugin, ...),
is **fully customizable** (fully customize the webpack config, the building, the server, the browser code, the routing, the rendering, ...), and is **performant** (code splitting, optimal HTTP caching, static rendering, server-side rendering, ...).

The [Reframe Rationale](/docs/reframe-rationale.md) goes into detail.
